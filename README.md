   ## ðŸ“š Projects

   - **Diecast Collection Website**
     - This was my first solo project and the one I am most proud of; it is a website that I built out of a 'What-if' idea. My boyfriend and I are massive Diecast car collectors in our spare time, so much so that we have had issues of buying two of one thing on accident. To remedy this, I thought of making a database in Excel to be able to quickly search through, but then realized what if instead of just a spreadsheet I made a full-fledged website to be able to view stuff on the go? My partner isn't quite as technically savvy as I am, so this solution would help him out quite a bit as well. 

   - **Data Mining Website**
     - Built a simple site to showcase data mining class projects during my Junior year of UNCC using  primarly Python and JavaScript.

   - **Capstone Course Bookstore Project**
     - Likely the most ambitious project I have worked on, for my Senior year at UNCC I did my Capstone Course, which I was assigned to a team and elected head devloper. Our task was to find an Online Book Store, critique it, improve upon its design using tools such as Figma, paper prototypes, etc. Have these tested for feedback by our peers, then we would build an actual site based on said feedback. This project took a few months during the fall of 2024, with myself contributing over 30,000 lines to the repo by projects end. I learned a lot of insight into node.js, react among other tools on the fly.  

   ## ðŸŒŸ Volunteer Work

   - **Edisto Beach Cleanup (2020-2024)**
     - During COVID-19 I stayed in the small town of Edisto Beach, and due to there being far fewer public resources available the beach became dirty very quickly. As such I and other local residents would go out usually once a week to survey the beach (when we were eventually allowed back on it) and pick up anything that washed ashore (or that people had littered). Although Covid has long since ended, this cycle continues to a lesser degree even now (or whenever I am in the area). It's a gorgeous small town, and it should stay that way!
     - I could list countless other Chairty walks I have done across Charlotte and the greater Mecklenburg area, but they would be too many to count (and most of these I did during my middle school / early high school years).
